### Support

If you run into troubles with running Teeworlds, there is a section in the forum called [Support](http://www.teeworlds.com/forum/viewforum.php?id=4) where you can get help from other players and from the developers. There is also an IRC channel on the Quakenet network called #teeworlds for general chatter and support.

### Development and supplying patches

If you want to help with the development, we suggest that you start at [Hacking](../hacking.md).
